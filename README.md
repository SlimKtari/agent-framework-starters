## Overview

This repository provides a curated collection of focused starter projects designed to help developers quickly explore common agentic patterns and bootstrap new solutions.

Each sample isolates a specific capability and is intentionally minimal so it can be easily understood, extended, or reused.

The repository is intended for:

- Learning and experimentation
- Workshops and hackathons
- Rapid prototyping
- Internal knowledge sharing

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution
3. Configure **User Secrets** to populate the required `appsettings` values for each project
4. Run any sample project
5. Browse:
- **/docs** → OpenAPI UI allowing you to run and test the endpoints  
- **/devui** → Launches the Microsoft Agent Framework DevUI to test agents or workflows

## Philosophy

These starters are designed to be:

- Focused — one concept per sample  
- Minimal — low setup and cognitive overhead  
- Practical — runnable out of the box  
- Consistent — shared structure and conventions  

They are not meant to replace official samples, but to provide scenario-driven entry points aligned with real development workflows.

## Contributing / Extending

This repository is expected to evolve over time as new patterns emerge.  
Additional starters, improvements, and refinements are encouraged.
